# 🖼️ Serverless Image Processing with AWS Lambda

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **serverless application** using **AWS Lambda**, **S3**, **API Gateway**, and **CloudFront**. It allows users to upload images through a web interface, apply image filters (grayscale, resize, rotate, crop, etc.), and perform **object detection** using **OpenCV + YOLO** — all without managing servers.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Upload images via presigned URL  
✅ Choose from 8 filters (Pillow & OpenCV-based)  
✅ Object detection (YOLO) with result preview  
✅ Result image + detected labels shown on page  
✅ Load testing using **k6**  
✅ Scalability charts created with **Python**

## 📊 Load Testing Example

Tests were run using **k6** with 15, 30, and 50 virtual users. The results confirmed AWS Lambda's automatic scaling under higher loads, with plots generated using Python.
